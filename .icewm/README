About icewm configuration files
-------------------------------

The directory /etc/X11/icewm used to contain copies of default configuration
files shipped with the icewm package. The original files were and are located
in /usr/share/icewm/ directory. This was considered service to the users but
it has also led to confusion and made package handling more complicated.

Therefore, the default configuration files are now only located in
/usr/share/icewm/ directory. To customize something for all system users, the
system administrator shall copy the particular file to /etc/X11/icewm when
needed, and icewm will automatically make use of that copy. Regular users can
do the same, installing their version into ~/.icewm/.

Note: for some settings, it's also possible to combine the default and
customized configuration, i.e. with "include" statements or the special
"prefoverride" file. See Icewm FAQ and Icewm Manual for more information.
