#### DOTFILES

"DOTFILES" repo contains configuration files of my personal workstation. I'm a minimalist so I like such kind of config concepts for daily workflow to do more with the less, efficiently. Hence, bare bone window managers and tiny tools as the resource is limited and these tools are simple, minimal, productive, efficient as well as customizable, unique and compact...

This configuration is for VOID Linux, also works fine with Debian 11 as well as Arch Linux.

If any info or help required feel free to drop an email at anikbiswas[at]hotmail.com, Thank you.
